## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I had trouble making the wording for the divs appear like the desired design within the same p so I had to get creative and try something. I wish to fix this in the future when I am able to understand what happened. It always happens that bugs appear when using divs.

First Div:

'''html
<div class="div flex">
       <img
        src="images/icon-ethereum.svg"
        alt=""
        aria-hidden="true">
        <p class="price">0.041</p><p>ETH</p>
</div>
'''

Second Div:

'''html
<div class="div flex">
        <img 
        src="images/icon-clock.svg"
        aria-hidden="true" 
        alt="">
        <p class="urgency">3</p><p>days</p><p>left</p>
</div>
'''

Notice the <P> section
